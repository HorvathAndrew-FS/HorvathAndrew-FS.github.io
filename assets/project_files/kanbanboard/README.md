# DWS2 Kanban Board Project â€“ Andrew Horvath

This project is a kanban board task manager project for a Web Standards class at Full Sail University.

## What is a Kanban Board?

The simplest way to describe a Kanban Board is that its a visual tool to aid a team or individual with their work flow<br> that is organized by smaller projects or tasks.

<br/>

Each task is divided into different sections or lists that are defined by project or scope of the board.

<br/>

I like to think of it like a white board or poster board with sticky notes on it. Each sticky note is a smaller piece to of <br>the greater project to be
completed in a specified timeframe.

## About the Project

This Kanban Board Project is a month long project with 4 milestones. Each milestone is a portion of the project to be<br> completed each week.

I will be using this project as a means to further my knowledge of SASS, JavaScript and Responsive Design Techniques.
